# Creating a Machine Learning Project for learning , how things actially structured when we are creating project

# STEPS--

# 1. Create a Setup file for packaging our intire project as a package , anyone can use our project as a package , downloading by pip , when we display it on pypy

# 2. Create a custom logging

# 3. create a customException for catch our exception , we easily find error occur in which file , which line as well as message

# 4. Data Ingestion , we are Reading data from a source , split it into train and test and also a row copy and save it into any folder

# 5. Data Transformation , we are using columnTransformer for transform our data , in which we use OneHotEncoder , SimpleImulator and    standardScaler

# 6. Model Trainer , we are selecting best model with fine tuning for best possible accuracy

# 6 creating a Pipeline for prediction , in which we are using our model and processor for transform our input data from app.py and apply model and predict outcome 

# 7 . Streamlit app , use a streamlit app for taking data and prediction
